# Jehova Research & Development

### To allow the building of Smart Contracts with Java based tools for Ethereum

#### Note: *This R&D paper was forked from [Java Abstraction R&D](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/ethereum-smart-contract-java-abstraction/tree/main/r%26d-files) with an overall goal of bringing more developers into the Ethereum ecosystem.*

# Estimated Roadmap:

## Year-By-Year

### 2022

- [ ] Complete base grammar/semantics

**Q1**

- Docs: 
  - [X] Begin building grammar and semantics of Jehova: [Grammar-Semantics-R&D](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/jehova/blob/main/R%26D-files/Grammar-Semantics-R%26D.md)
  - [ ] Begin building base syntax for library.

- Other R&D: 
  - [ ] Research how to implement a new compiler for Windows based systems (with Linux/MacOs next)
  - [ ] Learn how [YUL](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html) can be implemented from compilation from Jehova's semantics, syntax and grammar.
  - [ ] Open blog/s to reflect on discoveries and to also offer discussions.
