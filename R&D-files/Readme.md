# Jehova Research & Development

### To allow the building of Smart Contracts with Java based tools for Ethereum

#### Note: *This R&D paper was forked from [Java Abstraction R&D](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/ethereum-smart-contract-java-abstraction/tree/main/r%26d-files) with an overall goal of bringing more developers into the Ethereum ecosystem.*

# Estimated Roadmap 
## (5-10 year estimated completion time)

## Year-By-Year

### 2022

- [ ] Complete base grammar/semantics

**Q1**

- Docs: 
  - [ ] Carve out MVP blueprint *[[In-Development](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/jehova/blob/main/R&D-files/MVPblueprint.md)]*.
  - [X] Begin building grammar and semantics of Jehova *[[In-Development](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/jehova/blob/main/R%26D-files/Grammar-Semantics-R%26D.md)]*
  - [ ] Begin building base syntax for library *[announced]*.

- Other R&D: 
  - [ ] Research how to implement a new compiler for Windows based systems (with Linux/MacOs next) *[announced]*.
  - [ ] Learn how Solidity can be implemented to compile from Jehova's semantics, syntax and grammar *[announced]*.
  - [ ] Open blog/s to reflect on discoveries and to also offer discussions *[announced]*.
 

**Q2-Q4**
