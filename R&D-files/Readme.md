# Jehova Research & Development

### To allow the building of Smart Contracts with Java based tools for Ethereum

#### Note: *This R&D paper was forked from [Java Abstraction R&D](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/ethereum-smart-contract-java-abstraction/tree/main/r%26d-files) with an overall goal of bringing more developers into the Ethereum ecosystem.*

# Estimated Roadmap
